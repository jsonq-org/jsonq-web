# Vision

We imagine a world without language barriers when dealing with data sources. Why should developers
have to treat MySQL any differently than PostgreSQL? Or MongoDB?

What about Facebook? Twitter? Wikipedia? Fundamentally, these services provide data. Why, then, must
we treat them differently than traditional databases?

JSON/q aims to unify the way you talk about **any** data source, allowing you to easily incorporate
Facebook data into your business app, join across MySQL and Wikipedia, or join device SMS messages
with your in-app messaging.

# What is JSON/q?

JSON/q is a JSON-based specification for data access and storage. All operations are, fundamentally,
able to be represented as [JSON][] documents. By using JSON messages to represent data operations,
JSON/q provides a flexible base layer for building asynchronous language bindings.


# Project Goals

The JSON/q project is designed to make developers' lives easier by providing a unified specification for
accessing and querying data.

### Open Specification

We aim to provide a detailed and open specification for JSON/q. This will enable anyone to build
JSONq-compliance into their product whether it is a database, SDK, or web service. This openness will
also allow us to easily gather and incorporate feedback from everyone using JSON/q.

### Ubiquitous Promotion

The more places a technology exists, the more useful it is. We aim to promote JSON/q across the
software development world to have it supported in major browsers, databases, and webservices.
